This problem was asked by Google.
Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly linked?
For example, 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 returns True while 1 -> 4 returns False

This problem was asked by Dropbox.
Given a string s and a list of words words, where each word is the same length, 
find all starting indices of substrings in s that is a concatenation of 
every word in words exactly once. 

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], 
return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since
there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in s.
The order of the indices does not matter.

Write a function to flatten a nested dictionary. Namespace the keys with a period.
For example, given the following dictionary:
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo": {
        "a": 5,
        "bar": {
            "baz": 8
        }
    }
}
it should become:
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo.a": 5,
    "foo.bar.baz": 8
}
You can assume keys do not contain dots in them, i.e. no clobbering will occur.

#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #178 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.
Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.
The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.
The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.
Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.
