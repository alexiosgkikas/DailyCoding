#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #104 [Easy] 
```
This problem was asked by Google.
Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly linked?
For example, 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 returns True while 1 -> 4 returns False

#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #172 [Medium] 
```
This problem was asked by Dropbox.
Given a string s and a list of words words, where each word is the same length, 
find all starting indices of substrings in s that is a concatenation of 
every word in words exactly once. 

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], 
return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since
there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in s.
The order of the indices does not matter.

#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #173 [Easy] 
```
This problem was asked by Stripe.
Write a function to flatten a nested dictionary. Namespace the keys with a period.
For example, given the following dictionary:
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo": {
        "a": 5,
        "bar": {
            "baz": 8
        }
    }
}
it should become:
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo.a": 5,
    "foo.bar.baz": 8
}
You can assume keys do not contain dots in them, i.e. no clobbering will occur.

#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #178 [Hard]
```
This problem was asked by Two Sigma.
Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.
The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.
The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.
Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

#### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #185 [Easy]
```
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.
For example, given the following rectangles:
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
and
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height
}
return 6.

This problem was asked by Amazon.
Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.
For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7.
Do this in O(N) time.
